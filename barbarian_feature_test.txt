FeatureDescription=In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On Your Turn, you can enter a rage as a Bonus Action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength Saving Throws.
When you make a melee weapon Attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
You have Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
If you are able to cast Spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked Unconscious or if Your Turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on Your Turn as a Bonus Action.
